Run
-------
In order to run the app you need to:

	1. Clone the project
	2. Start Server: Run cmd in the Server folder and type: node ./bin/www
	3. Start React App: Open new cmd window and run npm start 
	4. Install Expo app on your Android Device and scan QR code that appears in your SpeedHack cmd window, voila...magic!
	5. Before login, register an account then try log in.

A couple of things to note:
	- Pretty sure by now you know how to npm install and all, if you do have a problem setting up email me at: malcolmmaima [at] gmail [dot] com
	- Make sure you have MongoDB installed on your local machine.
	- Before running the above steps, run **Mongod.exe** and **mongo.exe** located in your MongoDB program files folder.
	
Own Logic
-------
	- Replace the code in the render() of ProtectedView.js or (*even the whole file if you want,Knock yourself out*) to your own logic;
	- Be happy you idiot (^_^)

Be sure to report any issues, will give feedback ASAP!
